# gRPC Microservices Generator (gRPC-Microgen)

We are lazy team, we make microservices more simple, fast, and elegant!

## Motivation

gRPC is fastest microservices architecture, we can consume another service with gRPC. But gRPC is more complex to build from scratch.

## Feature

We make this code so easy to understand, you can create microservices only from the graphql scheme.

Features that we have and will make include:

- Generate Protobuf from graphql schema
- Generate gRPC server from Protobuf schema which is generated by graphql schema
- Generate each table and field which is needed by the server from the graphql schema
- Generate flow based on graphql schema (TODO)
- Graphql server with gRPC microservices (TODO)
- Docker and docker-compose

## How to Run Project

To running project, You can choose to use local or docker.

## Running Project via Local

To running project via local, You can follow this step:

1. Install MongoDB

    See the documentation to install MongoDB on your computer: [documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

1. Running Server

    - Before running the server, change ```.env``` based your MongoDB configuration
    - Running local server with this command:

      ```bash
      npm run start:dev
      ```

## Running Project via Docker Compose

To running project docker compose, You can follow this step:

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose
1. Running Server

    Running docker compose with command:

    ```bash
    npm run start:docker
    ```
